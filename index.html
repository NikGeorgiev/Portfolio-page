    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> My name is Nikolay Georgiev and I am a Sparta Global employee currently
    on assignment at Rockar. I finished my Java SDET course in novemeber and
  this is my first placement and I'm spending a lot of time preparing myself.
Today, I started learning Php and Html and I've made a good progress.
<br>
<br>
Before coming to Sparta, I studied Business Information Technology
at London South Bank University and managed to get a 2.1. During my time in
university I studied Python, Html and SQL as well as other not so technical programs such as
CMS's like Drupal.
<br>
<br>
In my free time I enjoy taking care of myself like going to the gym, cook healthy meals
and play sports like football and volleyball. I have a strong passion for cars
and fitness and health. </p>
